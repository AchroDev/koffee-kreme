## ~Changed~ AchroDev - 4/14/24
- Updated ko-fi button to HTML code with png instead of using the Markdown syntax as the image was unreasonably large.

## ~Changed~ AchroDev - 4/6/24
- Donate button was not accepted from ko-fi as an svg, updated to use a png version.

## ~Fixed~ AchroDev - 4/6/24

- Fixed the package.json from reading the ("vscode": "^1.17.0") as ("vscode": "^1.88.0") due to me misunderstanding the compatibility. All vscode editors 1.17 and up should now be able to install the extension.
