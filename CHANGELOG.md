# Change Log

All notable changes to the "koffee-kreme" extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Add other variants of theme to suite more light or dark styles, while still having good color contrast.

## Changed

- Fixed the package.json from reading the ("vscode": "^1.17.0") as ("vscode": "^1.88.0") due to me misunderstanding the compatibility. All vscode editors 1.17 and up should now be able to install the extension.
